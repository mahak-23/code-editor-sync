# Getting Started with Code Sync Editor

Code Sync Editor is a collaborative editing tool that allows multiple users to join a digital room and edit code or text simultaneously. It enables users to collaborate, discuss, and debug code in real-time, making it an invaluable tool for team projects and pair programming sessions.

## Features

- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Users can join a digital room and edit code or text together in real-time.
  
- **Multi-User Support:** Code Sync Editor supports multiple users, allowing teams to work together seamlessly.

- **Discussion and Debugging:** Users can discuss and debug code with the help of other users in the same room, improving productivity and efficiency.

- **Built with React.js:** Code Sync Editor is developed using React.js, providing a modern and responsive user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js:** Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Express:** Backend framework for handling HTTP requests and WebSocket connections.
- **Socket.IO:** Library for enabling real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers.
- **HTML/CSS:** Used for styling and layout of the editor interface.

## Usage
- Visit the URL provided by the development server or deploy the application to a production server.
- Create a new digital room or join an existing room by entering the room ID.
- Enter your roomId and click "Join" to join the room.
- Start editing code or text in the editor. Your changes will be synchronized with other users in real-time.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
